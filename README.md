# material-uploader
A uploader based on material-ui with good look.

The plan is to implement a simple and ease to use image uploader, maybe file uploader in the future, that accepts both link from internet and uploaded from local.

### Requirements:
- [ ] Should support `material-ui` v0.x.
- [ ] Add support to `material-ui` v1.x and above.
- [ ] Fetch an image from internet via a link.
- [ ] Upload an image from local.
- [ ] Multi-image support.
- [ ] Preview images after fetching or adding.
- [ ] Allow Deleting images while previewing.
- [ ] Confirm uploading after finishing.

### TODO:
- [ ] Initial design.(scratched on draft a little bit but need more polish and consideration of possible future implementation of multi-file support.)
- [ ] Implementation.
